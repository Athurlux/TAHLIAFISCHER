## Style Guidelines:

- Primary Color: A warm, deep earth brown (#A36629), reflecting the 'warm wood' aesthetic and representing grounding and strength, suitable for headings and call-to-action elements.
- Background Color: A soft, creamy off-white (#F4F2F0), providing a serene canvas reminiscent of natural cream tones, enhancing readability and photography.
- Accent Color: A muted sage green (#5A6732), used for highlights, links, and secondary interactive elements, aligning with the 'sage green' theme to provide natural contrast.
- Headline Font: 'Playfair' (serif) will be used for a distinguished and elegant feel in titles and main headers. Body Font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) will provide excellent readability for all textual content, including the longer narrative sections and interactive forms.
- Simple, clean line-art icons or stylized animal silhouettes will be utilized throughout the site, reinforcing the 'rustic professional' theme and the mission without visual clutter.
- The layout will be clean and organized, leveraging a responsive grid system to display high-quality imagery of horses prominently. Key information and donation calls-to-action will be strategically placed for maximum visibility, and long-form narratives will employ a distinct blockquote style for improved readability.
- Subtle, smooth animations and transitions, such as gentle fades or minimal slide effects, will be integrated to enhance user experience without distracting from the natural and grounded aesthetic.
